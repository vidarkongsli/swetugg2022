# Making **test-friendly** microservices with **DAPR**

# Testing...

???

* We are going to talk about testing
* A topic that is near and dear to my heart, and has been for many years

---

# DAPR

???

* And we are going to talk about DAPR. How many of you know about DAPR?
* Mind you, it is not Dapper - the lightweight object relational mapper, but DAPR
* We will talk more about DAPR later on, but first focus a little on the testing part

# The promise of microservices

What are microservices 游뱂?

1. Highly maintainable and testable
1. Loosely coupled
1. Independently deployable
1. Organized around business capabilities
1. Owned by a small team

???

* Point one: highly maintainable and testable
* There it is, testable. I would argue that this does not come automatically, you have to work for it. Let's have a look at the challenges and possible solutions
* Some of the other points are also interesting. Loosely coupled. Independenly deployable
* Let's keep these in mind for later

---

# Testing

## ... we really mean automated testing

???

* I am not too fond of many of the distinctions, like unit tests, integration tests, acceptancy tests and the rest of it
* Quite frankly, I do not care too much of the defintions.
* But before moving on, spend a second on what would be the ideal test to you...

# Testing

.img-width-all[![游뱡](images/testing-pyramid.drawio.png)]

???

* One way of looking at it is the so-called testing pyramid
* It tries to convey the number of tests you should have of the different types of tests
* You should have more unit tests than integration tests, and more integration tests than UI tests.
* The main argument here, is that the unit tests are easier to handle and quicker to execute than integration tests

# Testing

.img-width-all[![游뱡](images/testing-pyramid-api.drawio.png)]

???

* Of course, this talk is about microservices, so lets call them API tests instead of UI tests

---

# Testing

.img-width-all[![游뱡](images/testing-diamond.drawio.png)]

???

* I tend to disagree with this view, and I would say that maybe it should look like this.
* Maybe we could call it the testing diamond.
* Again, I am not too preoccupied with definitions of test types here
* But of course it depends on how you define a unit tests, meaning what is your definition of a unit?
* I use the definition that the unit is a type, or in OO often a class

# Testing

.img-width-all[![游뱡](images/testing-pyramid-upside-down.drawio.png)]

???

* If we take it a bit further, I could even suggest that we for a microservice would have something like this.
* With API tests, I mean that we test the microservice as a whole.
* Integration tests would be tests for various components within the microservice.

---

# Unit tests ("class tests")

* Do not catch problems "in between"
* Difficult to test for the correct conditions
* Spend much time simulating the environment; mocking and stubbing
* Too brittle in terms of refactoring - spend a lot of time rewriting
* Tests do not really have to be super quick
* A class of tests could be left to the compiler
  * Null checks
  * Input validation

---

class: center, middle

# *Let API or integration tests be the norm, and leave unit tests for the special cases.*

???

* So, the basic idea here can be summarized as follows
* The next question is how we can do this

# Hva er utfordringene med 친 utvikle microservices?

---

# Utfordring: avhengigheter

* Biblioteker
* API-er
* L칝re seg API-enes mekanismer
* Holde avhengighetene oppdatert

---

# Avhengigheter: eksempel

.img-width-all[![游뱡](images/dependencies_nuget.png)]

---

# Utfordring: testing

* Hvordan skal man kunne teste en microtjeneste
   * ... i isolasjon?
   * ... i lokalt utviklingsmilj칮?

---

# Utfordring: konfigurasjon

* Mange muligheter for 친 konfigurere en applikasjon
  1. Milj칮variable?
  1. Konfigurasjonsfiler?
  1. Kommandolinje?
  1. Diverse nettsky-alternativer
  1. I koden?

* Hvordan lage en kosistent konfigurasjon med milj칮avhengige parametre?
* Testing: Mocking / stubbing av alle API-er

* HTTP eller gRPC
* To-veis:
   * Applikasjon kaller Dapr API (*"pull"*)
   * Dapr kaller endepunkter som applikasjonen eksponerer (*"push"*)
