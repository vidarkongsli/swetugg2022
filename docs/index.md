# Software testing

???

* We are going to talk about testing
* A topic that is near and dear to my heart, and has been for many years
* I assume that you are have a basic familiarity with automated software testing
* ...that you have written at least one test in code before

# **Dapr**
# *Distributed Application Runtime*

???

* And we are going to talk about Dapr. How many of you know about Dapr?
* Mind you, it is not Dapper - the lightweight object relational mapper, but Dapr
* We will talk more about Dapr later on, but first focus a little on the testing part

# The promise of microservices

What are microservices ü§î?

1. Highly maintainable and testable
1. Loosely coupled
1. Independently deployable
1. Organized around business capabilities
1. Owned by a small team

???

* Point one: highly maintainable and testable
* There it is, testable. I would argue that this does not come automatically, you have to work for it. Let's have a look at the challenges and possible solutions
* Some of the other points are also interesting. Loosely coupled. Independenly deployable
* Let's keep these in mind for later

---

# Testing

## ... we really mean automated testing

???

* I am not too fond of many of the distinctions, like unit tests, integration tests, acceptancy tests and all the rest of it
* Quite frankly, I do not care too much of the defintions.
* But before moving on, spend a second on what would be the ideal test to you...

# Testing pyramid

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/testing-pyramid.drawio.png)]

???

* One way of looking at it is the so-called testing pyramid
* It tries to convey the number of tests you should have of the different types of tests
* You should have more unit tests than integration tests, and more integration tests than UI tests.
* The main argument here, is that the unit tests are easier to handle and quicker to execute than integration tests

---

class: center, middle

# Testing pyramid

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/testing-pyramid-api.drawio.png)]

???

* Of course, this talk is about microservices, so lets call them API tests instead of UI tests

# Testing *diamond*?

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/testing-diamond.drawio.png)]

???

* I tend to disagree with this view, and I would say that maybe it should look like this.
* Maybe we could call it the testing diamond.
* Again, I am not too preoccupied with definitions of test types here
* But of course it depends on how you define a unit tests, meaning what is your definition of a unit?
* I use the definition that the unit is a type, or in OO often a class

# Upside-down testing pyramid

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/testing-pyramid-upside-down.drawio.png)]

???

* If we take it a bit further, I could even suggest that we for a microservice would have something like this.
* With API tests, I mean that we test the microservice as a whole.
* Integration tests would be tests for various components within the microservice.

---

# Unit tests

* Do not catch problems "in between"
* Cumbersome to test for the "real" conditions
* Spend much time simulating the environment; mocking and stubbing
* Too brittle in terms of refactoring - spend a lot of time rewriting
* A class of tests could be left to the compiler
  * Static types
  * Null checks
  * Input validation
* Tests do not really have to be super quick

???

* To put some arguments to the upside-down testing pyramid, let's dwell a bit on unit tests

---

class: center, middle

# *Let API or integration tests be the norm, and leave unit tests for the special cases.*

???

* So, the basic idea here can be summarized as follows
* The next question is how we can do this

---

class: center, middle

# *Very well. But how? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*

---

# Integration tests in ASP.NET

* In-memory test server
* Craft requests to the application that execute in-process
* Nuget package [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing)
* Article: [Integration tests in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

# Integration test with Asp.Net

**EndpointTests.cs:**

```cs
[Theory]
[InlineData("/swagger")]
[InlineData("/health")]
public async Task GetEndpoints(string url)
{
  var client = _factory.CreateClient();
  var response = await client.GetAsync(url);

  response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();    
}
```

???

* Fires up the entire application in memory for the test
* The factory creates an HTTP client implmentation that acts like a normal HttpClient, but which do not send any requests over the wire
* This tests two endpoints in the application, and indirectly that the application can start up correctly
* But in order to achieve this, we needs some tricks up our sleeves

---

# DI container initialization

**Program.cs:**

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
builder.Services.AddTransient<IShortUrlService, EfShortUrlService>();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ShortUrlDbContext>(options => {
    var folder = Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData;
    var path = Environment.GetFolderPath(folder);
    options.UseSqlite($"Data Source={Path.Join(path,
      "shorturls.db")}");
});
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();
var app = builder.Build();
```

???

* Normal initialization of a dependency injection container might look like this
* Notice the adding of the DbContext: let's say, that in our tests we would like to use an in-memory database instead of Sqlite
* (I am not saying that this is strictly necessary, in fact there are good reasons for keeping sqlite in our test runs.)

---

# Changing DI for testing

**CustomWebApplicationFactory.cs:**

```cs
public class CustomWebApplicationFactory<TProgram>
  : WebApplicationFactory<TProgram> where TProgram : class
{
  protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
  {
    builder.ConfigureServices(services => {
      var descriptor = services.Single(d => d.ServiceType
        == typeof(DbContextOptions<ShortUrlDbContext>));
      services.Remove(descriptor);
      services.AddDbContext<ShortUrlDbContext>(options => 
        options.UseInMemoryDatabase("InMemoryForTesting"));
    });
  }
}
```

???

# Using test DI setup

**EndpointTests.cs:**

```cs
public class EndpointTests
  : IClassFixture<CustomWebApplicationFactory<Program>>
{
    private readonly CustomWebApplicationFactory<Program> _factory;

    public EndpointTests(CustomWebApplicationFactory<Program> factory)
        => _factory = factory;

    [Theory]
    [InlineData("/swagger")]
    [InlineData("/health")]
    public async Task GetEndpoints(string url)
    {
        var client = _factory.CreateClient();
        var response = await client.GetAsync(url);

        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();    
    }
}

# Challenge: dependencies

.center[.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/dependencies_nuget.png)]]

???

* One challenge to microservices is how to handle its dependencies
* A list of dependencies such as this might be familiar to you
* A list of dependencies such as this also becomes a challenge to testing
* The particurlar challenge for testing in a situation like this, is how to handle the fact that the service reaches out to third party serviecs via libraries
* With this challenge in mind, it is about time to introduce Dapr into the mix!
* Biblioteker
* API-er
* L√¶re seg API-enes mekanismer

???

* One central concept in Dapr is the sidecar pattern
* As you may or may not know, a sidecar is originally an extra passenger seat stitched on to a motorcycle
* Quite rear and quaint these days, but depending on your age, you may or may not have seen one in real life. I am revealing my age here...

---

# Interaction with Dapr

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/app-to-app-via-dapr.png)]

* HTTP or gRPC
* Two-way communication:
   * The application calls the Dapr API (*"pull"*)

# What does this mean

## ...for development?

.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/dapr-docs.png)]

???

* A developer would program against the Dapr APIs
* HttpClient is your friend
* Let's see how this would look like in code

---

# Named HttpClient

Program.cs:

```csharp
var daprHttpPort = Environment
  .GetEnvironmentVariable("DAPR_HTTP_PORT");

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("state", client => {
    client.BaseAddress
      = new Uri($"http://localhost:{daprHttpPort}/v1.0/state/");
});

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("publish", client => {
    client.BaseAddress
      = new Uri($"http://localhost:{daprHttpPort}/v1.0/publish/");
});
```

???

* Familiar with the HttpClientFactory pattern in .NET
* When the application runs in a Dapr-enabled infrastructure, the Dapr sidecar port is set as an environment variable
* The Dapr building block definitions give you the endpoint you need to call in the sidecar
* We use the "named" httpclient factory pattern

---

# Retrieve state

```cs
const STORE_NAME = "shorturls";

public async Task<ShortUrl> Get(string shortPath)
{
  var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("state");
  var result = await client.GetAsync($"{STORE_NAME}/{shortPath}");
  if (result.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NoContent)
    return ShortUrl.Empty();
  if (result.IsSuccessStatusCode)
  {
    return await result.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<ShortUrl>()
      ?? ShortUrl.Empty();
  }
  throw new Exception($"GET {result.RequestMessage?.RequestUri}"
    + $", error was {result.ReasonPhrase}");
}
```

???

* Create an HttpClient instance
* First path component is the store name, and second is the key
* If the key is not found, it returns no content (NOT 'not found', mind you!)
* Deserialize from Json into a typed object

---

# Save state

```cs
public record SaveRequest<T>(string Key, T Value);

const STORE_NAME = "shorturls";

public async Task Save(params ShortUrl[] shortUrls)
{
  var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("state");
  var result = await _client.PostAsJsonAsync(STORE_NAME,
    shortUrls.Select(shortUrl
      => new SaveRequest<ShortUrl>(shortUrl.ShortPath, shortUrl)));
  if (!result.IsSuccessStatusCode)
  {
    throw new Exception($"GET {result.RequestMessage?.RequestUri}"
      + $", error was {result.ReasonPhrase}");
  }
}
```

???

* Saving state is very similar, only use 'POST', and have the key as part of the payload
* Create a SaveRequest record to wrap the payload
* Can even save several objects at a time

---

# Publish to a topic

```cs
const string PUBSUB_NAME = "urlshortener-pub-sub";
const string TOPIC_NAME = "requests";

public record RequestEvent (string Id, string ShortPath, bool IsMatch,
  DateTimeOffset TimeStamp, string? Browser = null,
  string? Region = null, string? Country = null,
  string? IpAddress = null);

var requestEvent = new RequestEvent(Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
  shortPath, found, DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
  IpAddress: httpRequest
    .HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress?.ToString());

var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("publish");
await client.PostAsJsonAsync($"{PUBSUB_NAME}/{TOPIC_NAME}",
  requestEvent);
```

???

* Publishing a message to a topic is similar to saving state
* This time, we use the "publish" http client
* Need the name of the pub sub component and the topic name

---

# Subscribe to a topic

```cs
public record DaprData<T>
  ([property: JsonPropertyName("data")] T Data); 

public class EventNotificationController
{
  private const string PUBSUB_NAME = "urlshortener-pub-sub";
  private const string TOPIC_NAME = "requests";

  [Topic(PUBSUB_NAME, TOPIC_NAME)]
  [HttpPost("request")]
  public async Task<IActionResult> ReceiveRequestEvent(
    [FromBody]DaprData<RequestEvent> message)
  {
    var requestEvent = message.Data;
    var wasProccessedCorrectly = ...;
    return wasProccessedCorrectly
      ? new OkResult()
      : new StatusCodeResult((int)HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests); 
    }
```

???

* Now it gets more interesing
* Subscribing to a topic is different
* The integration here is a push to the application via a controller

---

# What does this mean
## ...for testing?

???

* We have now gotten a little insight into how the code will look like when interacting with Dapr
* Let's zoom out a little bit and what repercussions this will have for the application architecture

---

# Ports and adapters

### A.k.a. *Hexagonal architecture*

.center[.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/hexagonal-architecture.drawio.png)]]

???

* Let's consider the ports and adapters software architecture pattern
* It was coined some years ago by Alistair Cockburn, one of the authors of the agile manifesto
* An alternative to the earlier, layered archtecture for software
* Depics the business logic of the application to be at the core
* Ports provide a generic way to communicate with the business logic, separated into input and output ports
* Adapters implement specific ways the environment communicates with the application core (via ports)
* Separated into primary/driving adapters, and secondary/driven adapters

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)
https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/hexagonal-ports-adapters-architecture-e3617bcf00a0

---

# Integration tests

### ...with ports and adapters

.center[.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/hexagonal-architecture-integration-tests.drawio.png)]]

???

* One idea here is that we can create our integration tests by interacting with the ports, leaving out the adapters
* Since ports are generic, input ports can be driven by our tests, and the output ports will need test stubs and mocks set up
* Mocks will be used to verify expected side-effects of the test execution, stubs can be used to provide test data to our tests

---

# Adapters with Dapr

### ...are transparent, comprenesive, trivial?

.center[.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/hexagonal-architecture-dapr.drawio.png)]]

???

* So, how does our use of Dapr impact our architecture?
* Well, all the adapters essentially become HTTP-based
* The primary adapters are controllers if you use the MVC patterns, or plan Kestrel middleware if not
* The secondary adapters can all be based on HttpClient

---

# API tests with Dapr

.center[.img-width-all[![ü§∑](images/hexagonal-architecture-dapr-api-tests.drawio.png)]]

???

* So the idea then, if adapters are transparent and comprehensive, they can be included in our test runs
* We can test the microservice as a whole by poking at its interface with the world.
* The tests would call the microservice in the same manner as other, consuming microservices would do in production
* The microservice will produce calls to consumed microservice as it would do in production

# Tips and tricks

1. Build a catalog of request/response data
   * Embedded resources in your test projects
   * Use in stubs and mocks
1. Inspect Dapr API
   * Documentation at [dapr.io](https://dapr.io).
   * Use **REST Client** VS Code extension to poke at your sidecar
